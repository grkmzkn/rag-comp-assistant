# Corporate Knowledge Assistant

This project implements a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) based chatbot that helps users access and query department-specific information from PDF documents. The system uses FAISS for efficient similarity search and Google's Gemini Pro model for generating responses.

> **Note**: This is a demonstration project using synthetic data. The included dataset is artificially generated to showcase the capabilities of the RAG system and does not contain any real company information.

## Features

- üìö PDF document processing and indexing
- üîç Semantic search using FAISS
- üí° Intelligent responses using Google Gemini
- üí¨ Interactive chat interface (CLI and Streamlit)
- üéØ Context-aware answers
- üîÑ Overlapping text chunks for better context preservation

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Required packages (listed in requirements.txt)
- Google Gemini API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/grkmzkn/rag-comp-assistant.git
cd rag-comp-assistant
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv env
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
- Windows:
```bash
.\env\Scripts\activate
```
- Unix/MacOS:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

4. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Set up environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory
- Add your Google Gemini API key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### About the Dataset

This project uses a synthetic dataset created for demonstration purposes. The data:
- Simulates internal department documentation
- Contains artificial but realistic business scenarios
- Is structured to demonstrate RAG capabilities
- Does not contain any real company information

### Preparing Documents

1. Place your PDF documents in the `data` directory
2. Each PDF should contain department-specific information
3. Recommended document structure:
   - Clear topic sections
   - 75-100 words per topic
   - Multiple topics per department
   - Similar to the synthetic dataset structure

### Running the Chatbot

#### CLI Version
```bash
python src/chatbot.py
```

#### Streamlit Interface
```bash
streamlit run src/chatbot_ui.py
```

## System Architecture

The system uses a RAG architecture with the following components:

1. **Document Processing**:
   - PDF text extraction
   - Text chunking with overlap
   - Vector embeddings generation

2. **Search System**:
   - FAISS vector database
   - Cosine similarity search
   - Top-k retrieval

3. **Response Generation**:
   - Context retrieval
   - Prompt engineering
   - Gemini model integration

## Technical Details

### Models and Embeddings
- **LLM Model**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Embedding Model**: Sentence-Transformer (multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1)
  - Embedding Dimension: 384
  - Model Size: ~90MB
  - Optimized for question-answering tasks

### RAG Parameters
- **Text Chunking**:
  - Chunk Size: 150 words
  - Overlap: 50 words (33% overlap for context continuity)
  - Adaptive chunking based on sentence boundaries

- **Vector Search**:
  - Search Algorithm: FAISS IndexFlatIP (Exact Inner Product)
  - Top-k Documents Retrieved: 5
  - Similarity Metric: Cosine Similarity

### Generation Parameters
- **Gemini Configuration**:
  - Temperature: 0.5 (balanced between creativity and consistency)
  - Max Output Tokens: 2048
  - Top-p: 0.8
  - Top-k: 40

### Performance Considerations
- Memory Usage: ~200-300MB (base model + index)
- Average Response Time: 1-3 seconds
- Index Building: Linear with document size (O(n))

## Next Steps

Future improvements and enhancements planned for this project:

1. **Data Expansion**:
   - Integration with larger, real-world document sets
   - Support for more file formats (Word, Excel, HTML)
   - Multi-language document support

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Improved chunking strategies for better context preservation
   - Parallel processing for faster document indexing
   - Caching mechanisms for frequently accessed content

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Document metadata indexing and search
   - User feedback integration for response improvement
   - Custom training for domain-specific terminology
   - Real-time document updates and index maintenance

4. **Security and Access Control**:
   - Role-based access to sensitive information
   - Document-level security policies
   - Audit logging for compliance

5. **Integration Capabilities**:
   - API endpoints for third-party integration
   - Integration with document management systems
   - Support for real-time collaboration
